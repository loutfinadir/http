GitHub Copilot: Here's a step-by-step explanation of the flows when calling [`getModelMetadata(modelID)`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22getModelMetadata(modelID)%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A133%2C%22character%22%3A33%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition"):

1. **Logging the Call**:
   - The method starts by logging a debug message indicating that the [`getModelMetadata`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22getModelMetadata%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A133%2C%22character%22%3A33%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") method has been called.

2. **Fetching Metadata**:
   - The method attempts to fetch the provider metadata by calling [`this.dataExportServiceClient.getProviderMetadata(NAMESPACE_ID, modelID)`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22this.dataExportServiceClient.getProviderMetadata(NAMESPACE_ID%2C%20modelID)%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A111%2C%22character%22%3A17%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition").
   - This call is expected to return a metadata response as a [`String`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22String%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A133%2C%22character%22%3A50%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition").

3. **Logging Metadata Reception**:
   - If the metadata is successfully received, another debug message is logged indicating that the model metadata from SAC (SAP Analytics Cloud) has been received.

4. **Writing Activity Log**:
   - The method logs the metadata extraction activity by calling [`this.writeMetadataExtractionActivityLog(modelID, true)`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22this.writeMetadataExtractionActivityLog(modelID%2C%20true)%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A111%2C%22character%22%3A17%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") to indicate a successful extraction.

5. **Parsing Metadata**:
   - The method then parses the received metadata by calling [`this.dataExportServiceUtil.parseProvidersMetadata`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22this.dataExportServiceUtil.parseProvidersMetadata%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A111%2C%22character%22%3A17%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition").
   - This method takes the provider metadata response, a list of data import constants ([`FACT_DATA`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22FACT_DATA%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A141%2C%22character%22%3A54%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") and [`MASTER_DATA`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22MASTER_DATA%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A141%2C%22character%22%3A85%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition")), and a boolean indicating whether the session is a technical session.

6. **Returning the Response**:
   - The parsed metadata is cast to [`ModelMetadataResponse`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22ModelMetadataResponse%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A133%2C%22character%22%3A11%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") and returned.

7. **Exception Handling**:
   - If an [`AbstractServiceClientException`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22AbstractServiceClientException%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A117%2C%22character%22%3A17%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") is thrown during the metadata fetching process:
     - An error message is logged.

Here's a detailed explanation:

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Context**:
   - The method [`getModelMetadata(String modelID)`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22getModelMetadata(String%20modelID)%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A133%2C%22character%22%3A33%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") is part of a class that interacts with a Data Export Service.
   - The purpose of this method is to retrieve metadata for a given model identified by [`modelID`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22modelID%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A115%2C%22character%22%3A110%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition").

2. **Service Client**:
   - [`this.dataExportServiceClient`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22this.dataExportServiceClient%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A111%2C%22character%22%3A17%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") is an instance of a client class that communicates with the Data Export Service.
   - This client likely has methods to make HTTP requests to the service's API endpoints.

3. **Namespace ID**:

   - This response is expected to be in a format (likely JSON) that can be parsed to extract useful information about the model.

### Example Usage in Code
Here's the relevant part of the code for context:

```java
@Override
public ModelMetadataResponse getModelMetadata(String modelID) throws DataImportServiceException {
    log.debug("Get Model Metadata (Data Export Service Model Provider) called");

    try {
        // Fetching metadata from the Data Export Service
        String providerMetadataResponse = this.dataExportServiceClient.getProviderMetadata(NAMESPACE_ID, modelID);
        log.debug("Model Metadata from SAC received");
        
        // Logging the successful extraction of metadata
        this.writeMetadataExtractionActivityLog(modelID, true);
        
        // Parsing the received metadata
        return (ModelMetadataResponse) this.dataExportServiceUtil.parseProvidersMetadata(providerMetadataResponse,
                Arrays.asList(DataImportConstants.FACT_DATA, DataImportConstants.MASTER_DATA),
                this.sacSessionContext.isTechSession());
    } catch (AbstractServiceClientException e) {
        log.error(e.getMessage());
        this.writeMetadataExtractionActivityLog(modelID, false);
        if (Errors.isInErrorCode(Errors.ABSTRACT_SERVICE_CLIENT_RESPONSE_IS_404, e.getErrorCode())) {
            throw new DataImportServiceException(Errors.MODEL_DOES_NOT_EXIST, e);
        }
        throw new DataImportServiceException(Errors.MODEL_METADATA_CANNOT_BE_RETRIEVED, e);

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Method Signature**:
   - The method [`getModelMetadata`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22getModelMetadata%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A133%2C%22character%22%3A33%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") takes a single parameter `modelID` of type `String` and returns an object of type `ModelMetadataResponse`.
   - It throws a `DataImportServiceException` in case of errors.

2. **Logging**:
   - The method starts by logging a debug message indicating that the method has been called.

3. **Fetching Metadata**:
   - It calls `this.dataExportServiceClient.getProviderMetadata(NAMESPACE_ID, modelID)` to fetch the metadata for the given model ID within the specified namespace.
   - The response is stored in the variable `providerMetadataResponse`.

4. **Logging Success**:
   - If the metadata is successfully fetched, it logs another debug message indicating that the metadata has been received.
   - It also logs the successful extraction of metadata by calling `this.writeMetadataExtractionActivityLog(modelID, true)`.

5. **Parsing Metadata**:
   - The method then parses the received metadata using `this.dataExportServiceUtil.parseProvidersMetadata`.
   - It passes the `providerMetadataResponse`, a list of constants (`DataImportConstants.FACT_DATA` and `DataImportConstants.MASTER_DATA`), and a boolean indicating whether the session is a technical session (`this.sacSessionContext.isTechSession()`).

6. **Returning Parsed Metadata**:
   - The parsed metadata is returned as a `ModelMetadataResponse` object.

7. **Exception Handling**:
   - If an `AbstractServiceClientException` is thrown during the process, it logs the error message.
   - It logs the failure of metadata extraction by calling `this.writeMetadataExtractionActivityLog(modelID, false)`.
   - If the error code indicates that the model does not exist (`Errors.ABSTRACT_SERVICE_CLIENT_RESPONSE_IS_404`), it throws a `DataImportServiceException` with the error code `Errors.MODEL_DOES_NOT_EXIST`.
   - For other errors, it throws a `DataImportServiceException` with the error code `Errors.MODEL_METADATA_CANNOT_BE_RETRIEVED`.

### Code Explanation

```java
@Override
public ModelMetadataResponse getModelMetadata(String modelID) throws DataImportServiceException {
    log.debug("Get Model Metadata (Data Export Service Model Provider) called");

    try {
        // Fetching metadata from the Data Export Service
        String providerMetadataResponse = this.dataExportServiceClient.getProviderMetadata(NAMESPACE_ID, modelID);
        log.debug("Model Metadata from SAC received");
        
        // Logging the successful extraction of metadata
        this.writeMetadataExtractionActivityLog(modelID, true);
        
        // Parsing the received metadata
        return (ModelMetadataResponse) this.dataExportServiceUtil.parseProvidersMetadata(providerMetadataResponse,
                Arrays.asList(DataImportConstants.FACT_DATA, DataImportConstants.MASTER_DATA),
                this.sacSessionContext.isTechSession());
    } catch (AbstractServiceClientException e) {
        log.error(e.getMessage());
        this.writeMetadataExtractionActivityLog(modelID, false);
        if (Errors.isInErrorCode(Errors.ABSTRACT_SERVICE_CLIENT_RESPONSE_IS_404, e.getErrorCode())) {
            throw new DataImportServiceException(Errors.MODEL_DOES_NOT_EXIST, e);
        }
        throw new DataImportServiceException(Errors.MODEL_METADATA_CANNOT_BE_RETRIEVED, e);

GitHub Copilot: The method call `this.dataExportServiceClient.getProviderMetadata(NAMESPACE_ID, modelID)` is used to fetch metadata for a specific model from the Data Export Service. Here's a detailed explanation:

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Context**:
   - The method [`getModelMetadata(String modelID)`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22getModelMetadata(String%20modelID)%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A133%2C%22character%22%3A33%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") is part of a class that interacts with a Data Export Service.
   - The purpose of this method is to retrieve metadata for a given model identified by `modelID`.

2. **Service Client**:
   - `this.dataExportServiceClient` is an instance of a client class that communicates with the Data Export Service.
   - This client likely has methods to make HTTP requests to the service's API endpoints.

3. **Namespace ID**:
   - `NAMESPACE_ID` is a constant or a variable that represents the namespace within which the model exists.
   - Namespaces are often used to organize and manage resources in a multi-tenant environment.

4. **Model ID**:
   - `modelID` is a parameter passed to the method [`getModelMetadata`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22getModelMetadata%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fproviders%2FDataExportServiceModelsProvider.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A133%2C%22character%22%3A33%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition").
   - It uniquely identifies the model for which metadata is being requested.

5. **Method Call**:
   - `getProviderMetadata(NAMESPACE_ID, modelID)` is a method of the `dataExportServiceClient`.
   - This method sends a request to the Data Export Service to fetch metadata for the specified model within the given namespace.

6. **Return Value**:
   - The method returns a `String` which contains the metadata response from the service.
   - This response is expected to be in a format (likely JSON) that can be parsed to extract useful information about the model.

### Example Usage in Code
Here's the relevant part of the code for context:

```java
@Override
public ModelMetadataResponse getModelMetadata(String modelID) throws DataImportServiceException {
    log.debug("Get Model Metadata (Data Export Service Model Provider) called");

    try {
        // Fetching metadata from the Data Export Service
        String providerMetadataResponse = this.dataExportServiceClient.getProviderMetadata(NAMESPACE_ID, modelID);
        log.debug("Model Metadata from SAC received");
        
        // Logging the successful extraction of metadata
        this.writeMetadataExtractionActivityLog(modelID, true);
        
        // Parsing the received metadata
        return (ModelMetadataResponse) this.dataExportServiceUtil.parseProvidersMetadata(providerMetadataResponse,
                Arrays.asList(DataImportConstants.FACT_DATA, DataImportConstants.MASTER_DATA),
                this.sacSessionContext.isTechSession());
    } catch (AbstractServiceClientException e) {
        log.error(e.getMessage());
        this.writeMetadataExtractionActivityLog(modelID, false);
        if (Errors.isInErrorCode(Errors.ABSTRACT_SERVICE_CLIENT_RESPONSE_IS_404, e.getErrorCode())) {
            throw new DataImportServiceException(Errors.MODEL_DOES_NOT_EXIST, e);
        }
        throw new DataImportServiceException(Errors.MODEL_METADATA_CANNOT_BE_RETRIEVED, e);
    }
}
```

### Summary
- The call to `this.dataExportServiceClient.getProviderMetadata(NAMESPACE_ID, modelID)` is used to retrieve metadata for a specific model from the Data Export Service.
- It sends a request to the service, passing the namespace and model ID, and returns the metadata as a `String`.

   - This constructs the full URL for the metadata endpoint.

2. **Getting the Destination**:
   ```java
   Destination destination = this.getDestination(providerMetadataEndpoint);
   ```
   - [`this.getDestination(providerMetadataEndpoint)`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22this.getDestination(providerMetadataEndpoint)%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A97%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") is a method call that likely resolves the endpoint URL to a [`Destination`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22Destination%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A93%2C%22character%22%3A36%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") object.

- It then resolves this URL to a [`Destination`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22Destination%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A93%2C%22character%22%3A36%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") object.
- Finally, it makes an HTTP GET request to this destination and returns the response as a [`String`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22String%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A111%2C%22character%22%3A38%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition").
- If any error occurs during this process, an [`AbstractServiceClientException`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22AbstractServiceClientException%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A96%2C%22character%22%3A17%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") is thrown.

### Full Method Code
Here is the full method for reference:

```java
/**
 * Gets the metadata for a model/provider.
 *
 * @param namespaceID the namespace id to use for DES interaction
 * @param providerID  the provider id to get the metadata of
 * @return the string response returned by the metadata endpoint in JSON format
 * @throws AbstractServiceClientException if an error occurs in the client
 */
public String getProviderMetadata(String namespaceID, String providerID) throws AbstractServiceClientException {
    final String providerMetadataEndpoint = String.format(PROVIDERS_METADATA_BASE_ENDPOINT_STRING_TEMPLATE,
            namespaceID, providerID);
    Destination destination = this.getDestination(providerMetadataEndpoint);
    return super.get(destination);
}
```

This method is a crucial part of the [`DataExportServiceClient`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22DataExportServiceClient%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A98%2C%22character%22%3A52%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") class, enabling it to fetch metadata for specific providers by interacting with the Data Export Service.

The superclass might be named something like `AbstractServiceClient` or similar.

Here's a step-by-step guide to locate the implementation:

1. Identify the superclass of [`DataExportServiceClient`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22DataExportServiceClient%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataimportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdis%2Fcommon%2Fconnection%2FDataExportServiceClient.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A98%2C%22character%22%3A52%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition").

For example, if the superclass is `AbstractServiceClient`, you would look for the following methods in `AbstractServiceClient.java`:

```java
public class AbstractServiceClient {
    // Other methods and fields

    protected String execute(Destination destination, HttpRequestBase request) {
        // Implementation of the HTTP call
    }

    protected String get(Destination destination) {
        // Implementation of the HTTP call
    }
}
```

By examining these methods, you will find the actual implementation of the HTTP calls.

nadir-loutfi_sap: where the base url is defined

GitHub Copilot: The base URL for HTTP calls is typically defined in the configuration of the `DataExportServiceClient` class or its superclass. It might be set as a constant, a configuration property, or dynamically constructed within the methods.

To locate the base URL, follow these steps:

1. **Check the `DataExportServiceClient` class**: Look for any fields, constants, or methods that define or return a URL.
2. **Check the superclass of `DataExportServiceClient`**: If the base URL is not found in `DataExportServiceClient`, inspect its superclass for similar definitions.
3. **Check configuration files**: Sometimes, the base URL is defined in external configuration files (e.g., properties files, environment variables).

Here's a step-by-step guide to locate the base URL:

### Step 1: Check `DataExportServiceClient` Class

Open the `DataExportServiceClient` class and look for fields or methods that might define the base URL. For example:

```java
public class DataExportServiceClient extends AbstractServiceClient {
    private static final String BASE_URL = "https://api.example.com"; // Example

    // Other fields and methods
}
```

### Step 2: Check Superclass

If the base URL is not found in `DataExportServiceClient`, check its superclass. For example, if the superclass is `AbstractServiceClient`:

```java
public class AbstractServiceClient {
    protected String getBaseUrl() {
        return "https://api.example.com"; // Example
    }

    // Other fields and methods
}
```

### Step 3: Check Configuration Files

If the base URL is not hardcoded in the classes, it might be defined in a configuration file. Look for properties files or environment variables. For example, in a properties file:

```properties
# config.properties
base.url=https://api.example.com
```

And in the Java class, it might be loaded like this:

```java
public class DataExportServiceClient extends AbstractServiceClient {
    private String baseUrl;

    public DataExportServiceClient() {
        this.baseUrl = Config.getProperty("base.url"); // Example
    }

    // Other fields and methods
}
```

### Example Code

Here's an example of how the base URL might be defined and used in the `DataExportServiceClient` class:

```java
public class DataExportServiceClient extends AbstractServiceClient {
    private static final String BASE_URL = "https://api.example.com"; // Example

    public String getProviderEntitySetNames(String namespaceId, String modelId) {
        String url = BASE_URL + "/provider/" + namespaceId + "/" + modelId;
        // Make HTTP call using the constructed URL
    }

    // Other fields and methods
}
```

By following these steps, you should be able to locate where the base URL is defined in your project.

Here's a detailed explanation of the flow:

### Annotations and Method Signature

1. **`@GetMapping` Annotation**:
   - The `@GetMapping` annotation maps HTTP GET requests to the [`providerServlet`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22providerServlet%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A74%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") method.
   - The [`value`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22value%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A73%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") attribute specifies the URL pattern that this method will handle. In this case, it handles URLs that match `/providers/{namespace}/{provider}/**`.
   - `{namespace}` and `{provider}` are path variables that will be extracted from the URL and passed to the method as parameters.

2. **Method Parameters**:

It provides methods to set response data, headers, status codes, etc.
   - `@PathVariable final String namespace`: The `@PathVariable` annotation indicates that the [`namespace`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22namespace%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A75%2C%22character%22%3A59%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") parameter will be extracted from the URL path.
   - `@PathVariable final String provider`: Similarly, the [`provider`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22provider%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A75%2C%22character%22%3A97%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") parameter will be extracted from the URL path.

### URL Pattern

- The URL pattern `/providers/{namespace}/{provider}/**` means that this method will handle any URL that starts with `/providers/` followed by two path segments (namespace and provider) and then any additional path segments.
- For example, the following URLs would match this pattern:
  - `/providers/ns1/prov1/extra/path`
  - `/providers/ns2/prov2/another/path`

### Method Flow

1. **Request Handling**:
   - When a GET request is made to a URL that matches the pattern, Spring MVC will invoke the [`providerServlet`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22providerServlet%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A74%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") method.
   - The [`namespace`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22namespace%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A75%2C%22character%22%3A59%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") and [`provider`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22provider%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A75%2C%22character%22%3A97%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") path variables will be extracted from the URL and passed to the method.

2. **Processing**:
   - Inside the method, you can use the [`request`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22request%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A74%2C%22character%22%3A51%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") object to read any additional data sent by the client (e.g., query parameters, headers).
   - You can use the [`response`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22response%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A74%2C%22character%22%3A80%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") object to set the response data that will be sent back to the client.

3. **Business Logic**:
   - The method can contain any business logic needed to process the request. This might involve calling services, querying databases, etc.
   - The [`namespace`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22namespace%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A75%2C%22character%22%3A59%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") and [`provider`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22provider%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A75%2C%22character%22%3A97%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") parameters can be used to customize the processing based on the URL path.

4. **Response**:
   - After processing the request, you can use the [`response`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22response%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A74%2C%22character%22%3A80%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") object to set the response status, headers, and body.
   - For example, you might write JSON data to the response body or set a specific HTTP status code.

### Example

Here's a simple example of what the method might look like with some basic processing:

```java
@GetMapping(value = {"/providers/{namespace}/{provider}/**"})
public void providerServlet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response,
                            @PathVariable final String namespace, @PathVariable final String provider) {
    // Log the namespace and provider
    System.out.println("Namespace: " + namespace);
    System.out.println("Provider: " + provider);

    // Perform some business logic based on namespace and provider
    // For example, fetch data from a service or database

    // Set the response status and content type
    response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_OK);
    response.setContentType("application/json");

    // Write some response data
    try (PrintWriter out = response.getWriter()) {
        out.write("{\"message\": \"Success\"}");
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

In this example, the method logs the [`namespace`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22namespace%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A75%2C%22character%22%3A59%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") and [`provider`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22provider%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fcommon%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fcommon%2Fcontroller%2FProviderController.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A75%2C%22character%22%3A97%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition"), performs some hypothetical business logic, and writes a simple JSON response. The actual implementation would depend on the specific requirements of your application.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Logging**:
   - Logs the provider ID and whether the request is a delta request.

2. **Retrieve Metadata**:
   - Calls [`contentLibProcessor.getMetadataForResourceId(providerID)`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22contentLibProcessor.getMetadataForResourceId(providerID)%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprovider%2FSacDataProvider.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprovider%2FSacDataProvider.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprovider%2FSacDataProvider.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A377%2C%22character%22%3A53%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") to get metadata for the given provider ID.

3. **Check for Delta Data Request**:
   - Checks if the input parameters contain a key indicating a request for all delta data.
   - Sets [`isAllDeltaDataRequest`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22isAllDeltaDataRequest%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprovider%2FSacDataProvider.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprovider%2FSacDataProvider.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprovider%2FSacDataProvider.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A378%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") to `true` if the key is present and its value is `true`.

4. **Handle Delta Data Request in Tech Session**:

Here's a detailed explanation:

### Method Overview

```java
public List<SimplifiedColumn> getDeltaMetadata(List<SimplifiedColumn> metadata, String deltaTableName) {
    List<SimplifiedColumn> extraDeltaTableColumns = new ArrayList<>();
    for (SimplifiedColumn column : metadata) {
        log.debug("Replacing the '.' in each column from delta table with '___'. Necessary for odata filters");
        String encodedColumnDisplayName = column.getTechnicalName()
                .replace(".", SacDataExportConstants.MASTER_DATA_DISPLAY_NAME_DELIMITER);
        column.setDisplayName(encodedColumnDisplayName);
        column.setCompleteTableName(deltaTableName);

        log.debug("For all non key columns adding _OLD_ columns to metadata");
        if (!column.isKeyColumn()) {
            SimplifiedColumn newColumn = new SimplifiedColumn();
            newColumn.setTechnicalName(SacDataExportConstants.OLD_VALUE_COLUMN_PREFIX +
                    column.getTechnicalName().toUpperCase());
            newColumn.setDisplayName(SacDataExportConstants.OLD_VALUE_COLUMN_PREFIX +
                    column.getDisplayName().toUpperCase());
            newColumn.setPropertyType(column.getPropertyType());
            newColumn.setOriginalDataType(column.getOriginalDataType());
            newColumn.setKeyColumn(column.isKeyColumn());
            newColumn.setPrecision(column.getPrecision());
            newColumn.setScale(column.getScale());
            newColumn.setLength(column.getLength());
            newColumn.setCompleteTableName(deltaTableName);
            extraDeltaTableColumns.add(newColumn);
        }
    }
    metadata.addAll(extraDeltaTableColumns);
    metadata.addAll(this.getInsertionTimeAndOperationTypeDeltaColumns(deltaTableName));
    return metadata;
}
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Initialize Extra Columns List**:
   - Creates an empty list [`extraDeltaTableColumns`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22extraDeltaTableColumns%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A267%2C%22character%22%3A31%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") to store additional columns needed for delta table extraction.

2. **Process Each Column**:
   - Iterates over each [`SimplifiedColumn`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22SimplifiedColumn%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A266%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") in the [`metadata`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22metadata%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A266%2C%22character%22%3A74%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") list.

3. **Replace Characters in Column Names**:
   - Replaces periods (`.`) in the column's technical name with a delimiter ([`___`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22___%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A269%2C%22character%22%3A79%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition")) for OData filters.
   - Sets the modified name as the column's display name.
   - Updates the column's complete table name to the provided [`deltaTableName`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22deltaTableName%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A266%2C%22character%22%3A91%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition").

4. **Add Old Value Columns for Non-Key Columns**:
   - For columns that are not key columns:
     - Creates a new [`SimplifiedColumn`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22SimplifiedColumn%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A266%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") object.
     - Sets its technical name and display name with a prefix ([`_OLD_`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22_OLD_%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A275%2C%22character%22%3A54%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition")).
     - Copies other properties from the original column.
     - Sets the complete table name to [`deltaTableName`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22deltaTableName%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A266%2C%22character%22%3A91%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition").
     - Adds the new column to [`extraDeltaTableColumns`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22extraDeltaTableColumns%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fi051401%2Fdev%2Fgit%2Fdataexportservice%2Fsac%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fsap%2Forca%2Fdes%2Fsac%2Fprocessors%2FContentLibProcessor.java%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A267%2C%22character%22%3A31%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition").

This private method creates and returns a list of columns for insertion time and operation type.

```java
private List<SimplifiedColumn> getInsertionTimeAndOperationTypeDeltaColumns(String deltaTableName) {
    List<SimplifiedColumn> columns = new ArrayList<>();

    SimplifiedColumn insertionTime = new SimplifiedColumn();
    insertionTime.setTechnicalName(SacDataExportConstants.DELTA_INSERTION_TIME_COLUMN_NAME);
    insertionTime.setDisplayName(SacDataExportConstants.DELTA_INSERTION_TIME_COLUMN_NAME);
    insertionTime.setKeyColumn(false);
    insertionTime.setOriginalDataType(SacDataExportConstants.DATATYPE_TIMESTAMP);
    insertionTime.setCompleteTableName(deltaTableName);

    SimplifiedColumn operationType = new SimplifiedColumn();
    operationType.setTechnicalName(SacDataExportConstants.DELTA_OPERATION_TYPE_COLUMN_NAME);
    operationType.setDisplayName(SacDataExportConstants.DELTA_OPERATION_TYPE_COLUMN_NAME);
    operationType.setKeyColumn(false);
    operationType.setOriginalDataType(SacDataExportConstants.DATATYPE_TINYINT);
    operationType.setCompleteTableName(deltaTableName);

    columns.add(insertionTime);
    columns.add(operationType);
    return columns;
}
```
